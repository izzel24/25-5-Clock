## How It Works ðŸ”§
1. **Session Timer**: Tracks a user-defined work session length (default is 25 minutes).
2. **Break Timer**: Tracks a user-defined break length (default is 5 minutes).
3. **Audio Alerts**: Plays a sound when transitioning between work and break periods.
4. **Start/Stop Control**: Users can pause or resume the timer.
5. **Reset Button**: Resets all timers and settings to their defaults.
